## Interpret nonpareil outputs
### meaning of parameters generated by print(np)
| parameter | C-CDC-NNN-Lu-1-1 | interpretation from Nonpareil.R file                                | category            | unit | comment                                                     |

| C         | 8.139505e-01     | Dataset coverage (abundance-weighted average coverage)                                                    | Estimated coverage  |      |                                                             |
| LR        | 5.527319e+07     | Effective sequencing effort used                                    | Input .npo metadata | bp   | it approximates the file size containing only the sequences |
| modelR    | 9.991801e-01     | Pearson's R for the estimated model                                 | Projected coverage  |      |                                                             |
| LRstar    | 1.978262e+08     | Projected seq. effort for nearly complete coverage (95% by default) | Projected coverage  | bp   |                                                             |
| diversity | 1.582092e+01     | Dataset Nd index of sequence diversity                              | Projected coverage  |     

**diversity:** Nonpareil sequence-diversity index (Nd). This value's units are the natural logarithm of the units of sequencing effort(log-bp), and indicates the inflection point of the fitted model for the Nonpareil curve. If the fit doesn't converge, or the model is not estimated, the value is zero (0).

## Notes in parameter determination
**Pooling (pooling the samples, i.e., from different time points or different locations)**  
- Lax & Ohara & chng: the samples did not look like pooled based on the methods section.

**Sampling area**  
- Shen: Since the samples were aggregated, the sampling area was labeled as the weighted mean area of all samples.

**Touch frequency**  
[Citation for determining the touch frequency](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/pdf/guidelines/environmental-guidelines-P.pdf)   //  Sehulster, L. & Chinn, R. Y. Guidelines for environmental infection control in health-care facilities. Recommendations of CDC and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC). MMWR Recomm. Rep. 52, 1–42 (2003).

According to the reference, the following was determined manually.
- Lax & chng
- Mahnert: touch frequency of floor is designated to “low”
- Ohara: based on “Surfaces were chosen to include high-touch surfaces and medical equipment that came in close contact with patients and healthcare workers and could act as a source or sink for microbiota.” and Fig. 4c, all surfaces are designated to “high”.

# .R file description
## nonpareil/
1. basics.R
    - plot: sample_no_disctribution.pdf

2. cdc_nonpareil_visual.R
    - density plot of diversity
    - violin plot and box plot (effect of individual factor)
    - plot the relationship between diversity and LRstar
    - R-squared for all factors (get the explanatory power ranking) + generate a plot similar to variable importance plot for comparison.

3. cdc_nonpareil.R
    - plot mean coverage and mean diversity for samples in my study
    - examine the relaitonship between diversity and biomass
    - extract nonpareil parameters (diversity, LRstar...) from other studies
    - see if similar diversity produce similar curve
